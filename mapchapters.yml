  text: Opened on May 1, 1920, this hospital was origionally run by Catholic nuns. My grandmother
    worked here as a nurse for quite awhile. It has since been demolished but I still
    go there and park and talk about how I was born on this spot.

  text: My home town and a nice place to be! During the great wars, the city was a hub of activity and has since died down 
    a bit. It's still a fun town and I always look forward to coming home.

  text: This is a suburb of Sydney. Origionally there was plans to build a bridge across the 
    harbor and have a setup similar to Halifax/Dartmouth. The economy never took off enough
    to support such a development but imagine what could have been!

    quaint, it's my battlestation and command center in the woods. There are some nice hikes 
    around here too.
